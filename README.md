Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a first-year Information and Communications Technology engineering student from the north. While Iâ€™m new to web design and coding, Iâ€™m eager to learn, improve, and take on new challenges one step at a time.

Before starting my studies, I worked for six years in the restaurant industry, where I developed strong teamwork and communication skills. These experiences taught me the value of empathy, patience, and hard workâ€”qualities I aim to bring into the tech world.

Iâ€™m approachable, easygoing, and always open to connecting with others. Whether itâ€™s about coding, collaboration, or just sharing ideas, feel free to reach out!
